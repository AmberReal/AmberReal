👋 Hi, I’m @AmberReal
👀 I’m interested in music, web development and software engineering.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to use HTML, CSS, and Java Script to build a website from scrach.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on app development and integrating accessibility with software creation and operation.
📫 How to reach me: You can contact me at . . . Actually, I think I'll add that bit later.
